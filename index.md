> `“Only the hand that erases can write the true thing.”
― Meister Eckhart`

Why do we seek the grand order of the universe?
How is democracy, tyranny, etc. connected to science, computing, etc.?
What is the deep relationship between everything around us? and Why do such
relationships occur? These intricate relationships have an overarching
explanation that ultimately manifest themselves in technology through
inventions and innovations. Technology as a means is what we are here to discuss.
We undertake a purposeful job of understanding technology through its
invention and innovation in order to create targeted impact.
