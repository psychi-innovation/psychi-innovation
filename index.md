― Meister Eckhart`

Innovation is a fundamental concept of our reality. Understanding innovation
whether in biological or emergent systems, such as our economy, is key in making
sustainable progress.

We are optimising economic innovation.

We are *accelerating* the innovation process by creating new tools and methods
using the best knowledge there is to explain innovation.

### What we are working on 
- **Team formation.**  Using psychometrics and AI to bring the right people
  together to achieve success.
- **Strategy.**  Thinking clearly about strategy and communicating that is not an
  easy task; cognitive biases and lack of knowledge can lead to failure. We have
  created **The Innovation Estimate** to guide the innovator in validating their
  idea and creating a strategic plan through rigorous analysis.
- **Tools.**  Having the right tools and knowledge in using them is a simple but
  effective method in aiding the innovators.
- **Legal.**  The operating environment is influenced by policies and the legal
  systems. Therefore, understanding this and creating efficient means to
  navigate the legal environment is important.


### Leadership Team
 Psychi is led by Prof Philip Treleaven and Sirvan Almasi.
